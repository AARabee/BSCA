Y. Yang, M. Pesavento, Z.-Q. Luo, and B. Ottersten, "Inexact Block Coordinate Descent Algorithms for Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization," IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Dec. 2019. [Online] Available: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8931014, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04211. 

The matlab code is for two applications, namely, network anomaly detection and quadratic inverse problems.

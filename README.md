# BSCA
Matlab code for block successive convex approximation (**BSCA**) algorithms proposed in the following paper:

Y. Yang, M. Pesavento, Z.-Q. Luo, and B. Ottersten, "Inexact Block Coordinate Descent Algorithms for Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization," *IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing*, Dec. 2019. [Online] Available: [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8931014), [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04211). 

The matlab code is for two applications, namely, **low rank estimation** in Section V-A and **quadratic inverse problems** in Section V-B.
